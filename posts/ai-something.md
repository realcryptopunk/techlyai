As an Airbnb host, one of the most important aspects of your business is maintaining a clean and welcoming environment for your guests. Not only will this ensure that your guests have a pleasant stay, but it will also increase the likelihood of positive reviews and repeat business. Here are 5 tips for keeping your Airbnb in top shape:

##### Set high cleaning standards:

Establish a thorough cleaning routine and be consistent in following it. Make sure to pay attention to often overlooked areas such as baseboards, blinds, and under furniture. You may run into guests with dust allergies or sensitivities, you want to make sure complaints regarding these don't arise.

##### Wash all bedding and towels:

It's essential to wash all bedding and towels after each guest stay, even if they only stayed one night. This will ensure that your guests have fresh linens and towels during their stay, which can contribute to a more comfortable and pleasant experience. Be sure to follow the care instructions on the labels of your bedding and towels to ensure that they are properly cleaned and maintained.

It is also best practice to not ask from guests to do menial tasks such as placing the bedding in the wash as this does not contribute to a positive experience. You would not have to do this if you were staying at a hotel.

##### Stock up on high-quality cleaning supplies:

It's important to use cleaning products that are effective at eliminating germs and bacteria, as well as those that leave a fresh scent. This will help ensure that your Airbnb is clean and inviting for guests. Consider eco-friendly options as well, as they can be just as effective and are better for the environment. Some examples of high-quality cleaning supplies include:

- All-purpose cleaner
- Disinfectant wipes
- Glass cleaner
- Carpet stain remover
- Furniture polish

##### Disinfect high-touch surfaces

High-touch surfaces are those that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs, light switches, and remote controls. It's important to regularly disinfect these surfaces to help prevent the spread of germs and illness. This is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the virus can be spread through touching contaminated surfaces. Consider using a disinfectant spray or wipes to clean these surfaces.

##### Consider hiring a professional cleaning service

One of the best practices for running a successful airbnb business is to put in place a stellar cleaning team. If your airbnb is close to you and you have the time to clean it yourself, it may be more cost effective to do the cleaning yourself. However, this task can be arduous and time consuming. For these reasons we recommend hiring either a professional cleaning service in your area, or to scout local cleaners with experience. Professional cleaning services provide the benefit of highly experienced cleaners and an ease of mind, however they are usually highly priced.
An alternative to this would be to look for local talent. Look on your local job board or make a post on craigslist looking for cleaners. Scout individuals with prior experience of cleaning in general or best case cleaning other airbnb‚Äôs in your area. You should then run test trials with people that respond to your post, providing them with a checklist of what they should do including the prior best practices. Ask for before and after pictures with timestamps. It is best to 1 cleaner and 2-3 other cleaners that you could contact in case the first cleaner is unavailable.

In conclusion, maintaining a clean and welcoming Airbnb is essential for providing a pleasant experience for your guests and ensuring the success of your business. By following the tips outlined in this post, you can ensure you're following the best practices for cleanings. By taking the time to properly clean and maintain your Airbnb, you can create a comfortable and enjoyable environment for your guests and increase the likelihood of positive reviews and repeat business. Happy hosting!
